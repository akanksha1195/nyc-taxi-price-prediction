1. Introduction
  In this project centered around New York City's significant traffic challenges and the popularity of taxis as a mode of transport, we aimed to predict taxi trip durations using the "NYC taxi trip duration dataset". With NYC's enormous population of approximately 18 million people, traffic congestion is a pressing issue, making accurate trip duration predictions essential for travelers to plan their journeys effectively.
My project encompasses insightful visualizations illustrating the relationship between trip duration and various variables. Additionally, I explored how mean passenger count, total trips, distance, and duration fluctuate across different weekdays. To enhance the predictive power of our models, we employed extensive hyperparameter tuning techniques alongside machine learning models, including linear regression and decision tree. My project's journey begins with a thorough dive into data preprocessing, paving the way for enhanced insights and predictions.

3. Data Preprocessing
   During the data preparation phase, I conducted a series of crucial operations to refine the dataset. The distance is calculated between pickup and dropoff locations by computing the geographical distance based on latitude and longitude coordinates. Additionally, I transformed the pickup and dropoff date-time information into a datetime format.
   To further enhance the dataset's suitability for machine learning, I binned the time data into six distinct bins, allowing for a more granular analysis of temporal patterns. Additionally, several preprocessing steps were meticulously applied to the data, ensuring its readiness for utilization in my machine learning models. These preparatory measures laid the foundation for more accurate and insightful predictions.
